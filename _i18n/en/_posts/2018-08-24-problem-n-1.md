When I was starting in the world of Rails, performance within my applications was not very important. At the time I was improving on these issues and the code I was doing was becoming more solid based on patterns but still there were some things of the tools that managed to escape me. In this case **ActiveRecord**.

To present the problem imagine an application that collects many post from different users or authors

`rails g scaffold user name`

`rails g scaffold post title body user:references`

In Rails we would have something like the following

```
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
end


# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end

```

Now suppose that we have a view where all our posts of the different users are listed. In rails we would need the following

```
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end

# In our view
# apps/views/posts/index.erb

<%= @posts.each |post| do %>
  <%= post.title %>
  <%= post.user.name %>
<% end %>

```

So far it seems normal, but when we see the database queries we see the following

As you can see, there are 4 queries, one that calls all the posts, and 3 more for each time the user's name has to be displayed. Now imagine this on a much larger scale where we have thousands of users and each of them made a post, effectively the number of queries would be n + 1

**Solution**

To solve this, ActiveRecord provides us with what is known by **Eager loading**

```
preload()
eager_load()
includes()
```

You could replace the part of the query with any of the following options:

```
def index
  @posts = Post.all.preload(:user)    # Option 1
  @posts = Post.all.eager_load(:user) # Option 2 (Best option)
  @posts = Post.all.include(:user)    # Option 3
end
```

Query with **preload** e **include**:

Query with **eager_load**:

If we analyze the *preload* and the *include* what is done is to make a query for the posts, all the ids of the users are extracted and a query is made with these ids, then when it comes to accessing a field of the user this information will already be available. Whereas in the *eager_load* everything is done in a single query.
